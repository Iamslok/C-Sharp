Data Type:
---------------
Int integer stores(0 to 123 or 0 to -123),

double float point values, decimal 0 to 19.99 

char 'a'

string - "ndaskjdnkjasndkjas"

bool - true or flase(boolean)

Variables
--------

int a;

type variablename = value;

string name = "c#"

const int age = 10


Type casting
-------------

The process of converting one datatype to another datatype

implicit: small type to large type char > int > long > float > double

explicit: Large to small


implicit:

int age = 10;

operators

arithemetic operators(+, -, /, %, ++, --);

a + b
a - b


Conditional statement 

a > b
b< a

>=
<=
==
!=
>
<
||
&&

ternary operator

variable = condition ? "":""

While loop - the while loops as long as specified condition is True

Do/while - it will execute the code once and, then it will execute the while block code.

For loop - for(stat 1, stat 2, stat3){},

forEach - which is used to loop trought the array - foreach(string a in array){};

methods is block code and also know as functions

-- class myclass
{
	static void mymethod(){
		/
	}
}

static - this method belongs to myclass not an object;
void means this method does not return a value

method overloading--

multiple methods with same methods but with different paramenters
